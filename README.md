![script preview](https://github.com/YannisBnb/FiveM-RadialMenu/blob/main/preview.gif)

## üìã Description
This mod adds the following:

- Multiple options can be added into the menu.
- Works for all jobs by adding which jobs can use which options when the menu is open.
- Triggers client events which can be in other resources making it easy to setup with other scripts.
- Easy to use via keybind to access the menu.
- This is for the radial menu only and not the other scripts' events which are opening in the video.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
- Press the keybind for the menu (default: "F5") and hold.
- Move the mouse over to the option and click with your left mouse button.
- This will either do the action you use to do or open another sub menu.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Add to folder '[esx]'
Write 'start np-menu' in your server.cfg

To add your own events or jobs to this make the event you wish into a client event.
Then write the event name in where you want it to trigger it in the config file.

To add a job check to an option so only certain jobs will see it add the following to the return
    return (PlayerData.job.name == 'police' and not isDead)
- Replace 'police' with your desired job.
